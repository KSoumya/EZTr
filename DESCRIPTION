Title: Automated Discretization of Transpiration Features from High-Throughput Phenotyping Data
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Soumyashree Kar
Maintainer: Soumyashree Kar <ksoumya2301@gmail.com>
Description: Converts gravimetric sensors (installed at the High-Throughput Phenotyping platforms) data
             to evapotranspiration and transpiration profiles. Extracts 'transpiration restriction to VPD' features
             and computes feature heritability.
